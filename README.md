CUBE: Commodore Ultra Best Emulator

<br>

### Software
The whole core of this project revolves around a custom Linux distribution, [Combian64](https://cmaiolino.wordpress.com/). This custom OS is based on a lite version of Raspbian, but with a twist. You (should) never see the console, or any Linux-like UI. It boots directly to a full-screen emulator, VICE, complete with it's own menus. When you close the emulator (through the <kbd>F12</kbd> menu), it opens a system menu. This menu allows you to switch emulators, copy ROMs, connect to WiFi and more.

### Hardware
The whole system runs off of a Raspberry Pi 3 (which the case is designed for). This allows it to be small, and power efficient. The case is not necessary but it does make it look much better.

### Project Status (as of May 2, 2019)
Currently, I am designing a case for the whole thing. Once completed, it should be able to be 3D printed in two parts, the "tray" and the "cover".
